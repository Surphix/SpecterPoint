# SpecterPoint

## Purpose

SpecterPoint is a research initiative designed to enhance understanding of Command and Control (C2) servers, which are critical components in the architecture of cyber attacks. The project's objectives include studying the methods and technologies used to construct C2 servers, gaining hands-on experience in building a C2 server, and developing effective strategies for detecting these malicious infrastructures. By examining the lifecycle and characteristics of C2 servers, SpecterPoint aims to contribute valuable insights to cybersecurity defenses, helping organizations identify and mitigate the threats posed by such servers. The project also explores the latest trends and techniques used by attackers to maintain and obfuscate their C2 operations, thereby supporting the development of advanced detection and prevention tools.

## What is a C2 Server?

A Command and Control (C2) server is a central component of a cyber attack infrastructure. It serves as a communication hub through which attackers manage compromised systems (often referred to as "bots" or "zombies") and exfiltrate data or issue commands to carry out malicious activities.

C2 servers typically facilitate two-way communication between the attacker and the compromised systems, allowing the attacker to remotely control and manipulate the targets. They enable attackers to deploy malware, steal sensitive information, launch further attacks, or maintain persistent access to compromised networks.

To evade detection and maintain control over the compromised systems, C2 servers often employ techniques such as encryption, obfuscation, and proxy networks. Detecting and neutralizing these servers is crucial for mitigating the impact of cyber attacks and safeguarding against future threats.

## Why are C2 Servers Important?

C2 Servers can be an important component of cyber attacks for several reasons:
  - Remote Control: C2 servers enable attackers to remotely control compromised systems, execute commands, and exfiltrate data.
  - Persistence: C2 servers help attackers maintain persistent access to compromised networks, allowing them to return and launch further attacks.
  - Coordination: C2 servers facilitate coordination among multiple compromised systems, enabling attackers to orchestrate large-scale attacks.
  - Data Exfiltration: C2 servers serve as a conduit for exfiltrating sensitive data from compromised systems to the attacker's infrastructure.
  - Malware Deployment: C2 servers are used to deploy malware on compromised systems, enabling attackers to expand their control and carry out additional malicious activities.

## How Can SpecterPoint Help?

By documenting the lifecycle and characteristics of C2 servers, SpecterPoint aims to provide valuable insights into the methods and technologies used by attackers to construct and maintain these infrastructures. This knowledge can help cyber security professionals and organizations develop effective strategies for detecting and neutralizing C2 servers, thereby enhancing their cybersecurity defenses.

## How does SpecterPoint Differentiate Itself?

There is nothing special about SpecterPoint. This project solely aims to build a fundamental understanding of C2 servers and contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing knowledge and insights gained through research and hands-on experience. The project does not claim to be unique or groundbreaking but rather seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of C2 servers and their role in cyber attacks.

## How will SpecterPoint be developed?

Each of the components will be written with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The client will be developed with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a framework for building web applications with Rust. The server will be developed with [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/), a web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.
